# Determine the origin of Wines using ANN

## Objective
Use ANN on data obtained by chemical analysis to determine the origin of wines. The wines are classified as from either of the three cultivars in Italy.

## Dataset used

The dataset used is publicly available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).
The data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

The attributes are -
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash  
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins
10) Color intensity
11) Hue
12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13) Proline
