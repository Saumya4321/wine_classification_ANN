# Determine the origin of Wines using FNN

## Objective
Develop an Feed forward Neural network (FNN) to classify the origin of wines based on chemical analysis data, distinguishing among three distinct cultivars from Italy.
Given the values of 13 chemical constituents of a sample wine, the goal is to distinguish from which of the three cultivars it is from.

## Dataset used

The dataset used is publicly available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).
The data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.
The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

The attributes are -
